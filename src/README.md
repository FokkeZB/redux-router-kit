# Redux Router Kit

![router-for-ants](https://i.imgflip.com/vah1n.jpg)

Redux Router Kit aims to be a minimalistic router that fits well with Redux and React. It provides:

- Redux action types for routing.
- Redux action creators for routing.
- Redux middleware for some handling of routes, for example onEnter and onLeave hooks.
- Redux reducer for adding routing information (url) to the store state.
- Utilities for matching URLs to routes.
- An Addressbar component that abstracts the browser's history as a component with `value` and `onChange` props.
