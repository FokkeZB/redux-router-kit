# Redux Router Kit

Redux Router Kit aims to be a _relatively_ minimalistic router that fits well with Redux and React. Some basics are
built-in, but you can stitch together its pieces for a customized solution. It provides:

- Redux action types for routing.
- Redux action creators for routing.
- Redux middleware for some handling of routes, for example onEnter and onLeave hooks.
- Redux reducer for adding routing information to the store state.
- Some utilities, including matching URLs to routes.
- A History component that abstracts the browser's history as a React component.
- A Router component that does maps routes to components.
- Some other etc.
